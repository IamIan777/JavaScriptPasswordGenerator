# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

I created the ability for the starter code to generate numbers, special characters, uppercase, and lower case letters based off of the criteria I was given.

### Usage

You can generate a password by:
    1) typing a number between 8 and 128
    2)if  the answer is not in the acceptable parameters then you will be asked to try again
    3)Next you will be given prompts to add uppercase, lowercase, and special characters
    4)if selected all, then your password will be generated
